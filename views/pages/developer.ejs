                        <strong>Hello ðŸ‘‹</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll agree that, at this point, it isnâ€™t an exaggeration to say that we are at war against the 
                        coronavirus and that it is a war we must win.

                        <strong>COVID-19</strong> or pandemic. This restricts the whole of India under lockdown. Everything is closed and 
                        restricts us at our home. You can choose to sleep, playingÂ PUBG, doing nothing or you could utilize this break to 
                        learn something new. If you don't come out of this quarantine with new skill, you never lacked time, you lacked discipline.
                        Be organize, love everyone, help your mother even this break she did not take a break. <strong> Turn Your Self-Isolation 
                        into Self-Improvement!</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        Together we are facing an unprecedented time that is affecting all of our community, our families, and our way of life. 
                        As the nation battles to curb the impact of the coronavirus, our one and only responsibility right now is to stay safe 
                        and practice social distancing. The next few weeks are critical in this battle. I request everyone to stay at home and 
                        enjoy good time with family.
                        <br><br>
                        Let's fight with Corona together! ðŸ˜·
